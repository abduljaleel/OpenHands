## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title and Description

- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of your changes
- Reference related issues using the GitHub issue reference syntax (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Include any necessary context or background information

### PR Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] Tests have been added or updated
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] The code builds without errors
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies have been added
- [ ] No sensitive information is included

## Code Review Process

### Reviewer Responsibilities

- Review code for correctness, style, and performance
- Provide constructive feedback
- Suggest improvements
- Approve or request changes

### Author Responsibilities

- Respond to feedback in a timely manner
- Address all requested changes
- Explain design decisions when necessary
- Be open to suggestions and improvements

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages

- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide a detailed description in the body if necessary
- Reference related issues in the body

Example:
```

### Commit Organization

- Keep commits small and focused
- Group related changes in a single commit
- Separate unrelated changes into different commits
- Rebase and squash commits before submitting a pull request

## Branch Management

### Branch Naming

- Use descriptive names for branches
- Follow the pattern: `type/description`
- Types include: `feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`

Examples:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `test/add-integration-tests`
- `refactor/improve-performance`

### Branch Lifecycle

- Create a branch for each feature or bugfix
- Keep branches up to date with the main branch
- Delete branches after they are merged

## Continuous Integration

OpenHands uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- All pull requests are automatically tested
- Tests must pass before a pull request can be merged
- Code coverage is tracked and should not decrease
- Linting is enforced to maintain code quality

## Release Process

OpenHands follows a semantic versioning approach:

- **Major version**: Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version**: Backward-compatible functionality
- **Patch version**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

The release process involves:

1. Creating a release branch
2. Updating version numbers
3. Generating release notes
4. Creating a GitHub release
5. Publishing Docker images
